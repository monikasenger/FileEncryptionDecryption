# FileEncryptionDecryption

# I created a program that allows users to:
# 1.Choose between encryption or decryption of file contents.
# 2.Input the file name or file path using a Swing-based interface.
# 3.Encrypt or decrypt the file and save the result to a new file.
# 4.The program uses Swing components such as text fields and buttons to facilitate the file selection and operation.
